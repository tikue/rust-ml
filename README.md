[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/tikue/rust-ml.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/tikue/rust-ml)

A machine learning library implemented in rust.
Currently provides:
* A basic kmeans implementation for 2-D points (future work: support arrays of arbitrary length)
* A basic ascii-printable graph

## Running the example program
```
cargo build
```
Then, from the root of the directory:
```
target/main
```
